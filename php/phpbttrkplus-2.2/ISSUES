WARNING: PHP Bug!
=================

In PHP versions < 4.3.11 there is a bug in the upload files routines internal
to PHP. This affects uploading torrents with an apostrophe (') in the
filename. Everything to the left of the apostrophe (including the apostrophe
itself) gets truncated.

While not a very serious bug, it can be annoying. You may consider upgrading
to 4.3.11.


OTHER ISSUES
============

(In no particular order)

- For reasons that make no sense, the summary page can occasionally get
  negative numbers in the results. That's what bta_consistency.php is for, but this
  script causes the tracker to become unresponsive while working. 
  You may want to crontab bta_consistency.php every 3 hours or so.
- Speed tracking is rough at best. When starting or after long periods of
  inactivity, it might take up to half an hour to become accurate. It will
  most likely be understated most of the time.
