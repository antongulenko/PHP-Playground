WARNING: PHP BUG!
-----------------

There is a bug that is present in some versions of PHP. It has been fixed in
version 4.3.11 and newer.

It has to do with how PHP handles file uploads when get_magic_quotes_gpc is
enabled. (Most have this enabled.) If you upload a file with an apostrophe
(') in the filename, the filename will get truncated and you will get whatever
is to the right of the apostrophe.

It is recommended to upgrade to 4.3.11 if you can. It's not a real serious bug
but it sure can be annoying.

Changes between PHPBTTracker+ 2.2 and PHPBTTracker+ 2.1
-------------------------------------------------------

-THIS SOFTWARE NOW REQUIRES MYSQL 4.1.2 OR GREATER
-The RSS feed is a little smarter dealing with URL encoding.
-The peers and seed summary screen shows a decoded client version (not just the 
 user-agent string.)
-Use of mysql_escape_string discontinued, replaced with mysql_real_escape_string.
-In the caching table, the compact field's type has been changed to BINARY. This is
 done to prevent weird situations of the tracker passing out corrupt ip addresses while
 using the compact specification.
-The install.php script has been changed to report errors about the SQL statements,
 and the invalid SQL has been corrected.
-The install.php script attempts to detect the mysql version running, and notify the
 user if the tracker is compatible with it.
-The statistics script has been adjusted to deal with EB/PB/TB.
-index_sample.php now displays a page generation time.
-The add torrent page will try to automatically extract the CRC from the filename in the
 torrent, if one is there in between brackets (either [],(), or {}).
-The RSS feed has been expanded to allow individual feeds for subcategories that can appear
 on the main page. These are present only in the "Live feeds/Live bookmarks" of the browser.
-A rudimentary search feature has been added. It's a self-inclusive script that can be
 modified to suit whatever your needs are. It can also accept input from custom pages,
 provided that the form POST variable points to the script and the form search field is
 named 'searchterms'. This information is also in the search.php script in the header.
 
Changes between PHPBTTracker+ 2.1 and PHPBTTracker+ 2.0
-------------------------------------------------------

-You can now replace the stats of a torrent with a comment.
-Admin interface rearranged (merged 4 columns together, takes up significantly
 less screen real estate now.) Also, hiding a bunch of torrents at the same
 time is possible now.
-Fixed a small bug when uploading torrents to the database. The script will
 add the gettorrent.php URL to the directory above the administration script.
 (ie. if your tracker is in /tracker/admin, the script will now use
  /tracker/gettorrent.php as the URL address.)
-Fixed a little bug with external torrents. The tracker will not assume external
 torrents are active unless the dynamic_torrents setting is enabled.
-Fixed a small glitch in the retired torrents screen. If viewing a group the page
 will not provide the 'Jump To' links (root user only).
-Fixed a small glitch in the main torrent page. When logged in as root and you are
 viewing a group it won't show the 'Jump To' links. Also changed the name of one of the
 buttons.
-Torrent grouping and manual sorting has been added to the index pages. These will
 only work when not using dynamic torrents.
-Fixed a minor glitch in bta_add.php. When uploading torrents with a '%' in the filename
 there shouldn't be any bad requests from the URL that is generated automatically.
-Updated the help scripts with current information.
-Supressed warnings in external.php.
-The index_sample and retired_sample scripts are now pure CSS. I think.
-Internal RSS feed implemented. It can either run real-time or the scripts
 can cache the results to a writeable directory on the webserver. The index
 scripts have been updated to deal with this and the links will automatically
 change depending on the caching setting. Live feeds are also included.
-A statistics script is provided to let you know how the tracker is doing.
 (statistics.php).

Changes between PHPBTTracker+ 2.0 and PHPBTTracker+ 1.7
-------------------------------------------------------

-Now uses the PHPBT 1.5 core. (2 main features: peer caching and compact
 protocol support, plus other optimizations.)
-new configuration variable $GLOBALS["doavg"] added, allowing for a quick way
 to disable this calculation on heavily loaded trackers. If using the scripts
 provided, they will not show the average column when this is disabled.
-new configuration variable $GLOBALS["heavyload"] added, which will disable
 amount downloaded, speed, and average stats. It also includes a miniscule
 speed improvement in tracker.php. If using the scripts provided, they will
 not show the XFER, speed, and Avg done columns if this is set.
-The original phpbttracker has a variable $GLOBALS["countbytes"] which will
 prevent the script from updating the amount downloaded and speed. If you are
 using the sample scripts provided the affected columns will not be shown if
 this value is turned off.
-A seperate username and password is now set in config.php! If you don't set
 these the administration interface will remain disabled to everyone!


Changes between PHPBTTracker+ 1.7 and PHPBTTracker+ 1.6
-------------------------------------------------------


-Any reference to sha1lib.php has been removed. Use PHP 4.3.0 or higher,
 as indicated in the Requirements section of the sf.net webpage.

-The consistency check has been moved to maintenance.php. Installations
 that have cron'd the bta_consistency.php script can remove it, or it
 will check twice.

-The tracker is now proxy-aware. It will extract the real IP from the headers
 if one is provided.

-A couple bugs have been fixed in the IP banning module, somewhat related to
 the proxy change. NOTE: the table structure has changed! upgrade.php will make
 the modifications necessary and attempt to update all the bans.

-The script that updates external torrents has been updated to optionally use
 the info_hash parameter to request stats from external trackers. A new 
 configuration parameter $GLOBALS["ext_batch_scrape"] has been added to
 config.php and if set to true will request all scrape data, otherwise
 will request info using the info_hash parameter. If this is not defined
 in config.php the info_hash parameter is used by default.

-Index scripts updated. They will now show a '?' for external torrents that
 do not report a total download value.

-Possible bug in index scripts fixed, regarding use of parameters.

-Usernames and category names are no longer allowed to have spaces in them.
 Fixed various scripts to enforce this.

-Add torrent bug fixed: uploading zero-byte torrents doesn't make the script
 add as an external torrent anymore.

-A new user permission has been added: Add Mirror Torrent. This makes use of
 backup trackers in the torrent file, and when this is selected, allows the
 torrent to be added when the tracker is not the primary. NOTE: The announce
 url has to appear in the backup list! Prior to V1.7, this was added as an
 external torrent. There is a new option under 'Add Torrent' for this.

-Edit torrent now has the capability to make an external torrent a normal one.
 This is not reversible. You need add external torrent permission to use
 this feature.

-You can enable/disable users without removing them, and provide a reason
 which will be shown if the user logs in and their account is disabled.

-Add Torrent: If the torrent was not copied to the torrent folder, a
 warning message is displayed to the user.

-Add Torrent: Torrent size is calculated properly now. Previously it was
 an educated guess at the actual size and was not 100% accurate.

-Support for webserver farms has been added. If you have a website with 
 multiple servers, you are not guaranteed to get the same webserver with the 
 session data as you move around the administration interface. Two new globals
 are set in config.php to get around this. See config.php for more detail.

-A button has been added to the IP Banning interface to remove all bans
 listed. There is no confirmation for this so be careful when using it!

-Provision in Add Torrent screen to upload torrent only, without adding
 to tracker. Intended for when reviving torrents and the original torrent
 is not on the tracker.

-Ability has been added to add torrents directly in the database instead
 of on the webserver's local filesystem. See config.php for a new variable
 called $GLOBALS["move_to_db"] for more details. A new script is provided
 (gettorrent.php) for retrieving them from the database, all that is needed
 is to specify an info_hash parameter. i.e. gettorrent.php?info_hash=<hash>
 The torrents are base64 encoded to keep their integrity in the database.

-Administration interface now totals external torrents seperately.

-Sample index scripts now total external torrents seperately.

-Administration interface (when logged on as root) will now remember the last
 category you were browsing. If you navigate around it will not show all the
 torrents if you select a specific category.

-Records in timestamps table are removed when removing torrents.

Changes between PHPBTTracker+ 1.6 and the original PHPBTTracker 1.4
-------------------------------------------------------------------

-Tracks how much the peers are uploading to the torrent
-The client version is also tracked
-Average torrent progress is calculated
-Scrape output modified to show extra fields (speed/avg done, etc)
-Tracker can ban by IP address
-Client minimum versions can be enforced and some old client can be
 banned automatically by IP address for a specified time
-Ability to add external torrents and refresh the stats
-Scrape decoder script example is provided
-Full administration interface using PHP sessions and Javascript
 added (shows all sorts of information on peers, etc)
-Extra fields are provided when adding a torrent to display optional
 information
-Uploading of torrents to webserver
-Multi user administration interface if needed
